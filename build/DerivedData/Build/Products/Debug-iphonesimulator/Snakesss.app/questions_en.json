    "funFact": "Google claimed 'quantum supremacy' in 2019 when its 53-qubit Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds that would take classical computers 10,000 years. IBM disputed this estimate. Quantum computers use qubits that can be in superposition (0 and 1 simultaneously)."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "funFact": "The Byzantine Generals Problem (1982) describes how distributed systems can reach consensus even when some components behave maliciously or incorrectly. Solving it is central to blockchain technology — Bitcoin's proof-of-work mechanism is one solution to this problem."
